# TODO

- ~~Place dough in it's own package.~~
- ~~Migrate existing code to null safety.~~
    - ~~Transformer should be late final.~~
    - ~~Ensure all APIs are good.~~
    - ~~Migrate the example to null safety.~~
    - ~~Make sure the widgets are still functional.~~
- Move dough that uses sensors to it's own `dough_sensors` package because they introduce platform dependency.
    - Use the [web support](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/plus_plugins/tree/main/packages/sensors_plus) for sensors.
- Deprecate prefs and use data instead.
- Create recipe for each widget that uses data.
- Update dough readme to include updated spec and migration guide.
- Update root readme to include demos from each project.
- Add list view dough widget.
- Add reorderable list dough widget.
